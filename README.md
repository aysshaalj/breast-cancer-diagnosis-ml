# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies a probabilistic machine learning approach to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using diagnostic medical data.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`)
- 30 real clinical diagnostic features

## Model
- Gaussian Naive Bayes implemented from scratch in Python

## What I Implemented
- Prior probability and likelihood calculations
- Gaussian probability density function
- Custom prediction logic
- Train/test splitting and evaluation

## Tools
Python, NumPy, scikit-learn

## How to Run
Open `NaiveBayes.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter and run all cells.
